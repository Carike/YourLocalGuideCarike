# Your Local Guide Carike

_**Sharing my love for new experiences and travelling with others using the Local Guides platform from Google.**_

## Being a Local Guide

I love to travel and experience new things whether it's an activity, a new restaurant or some retail therapy. 

Google's Local Guide program allows me to share that with others and also acknowledge great customer service at these establishments. 

### One Accessibility

Helping others by making information available is a great way to contribute to the community, but what if this information was not just about which restaurants are great, but also accessible to those who make use of a wheelchair before standing in front of the doors and unable to enter?

This is where the One Accessibility initiative comes in and where everyone can help make our world a more accessible one. So here I like to take photos of ramps, restaurants with Braille menus. Most people don't realise it, but this information could also be used by others, for example, wheelchair-accessible locations would also be suitable for parents with strollers.
